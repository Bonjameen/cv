        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I've been programming for the past 6 years now, from python, html, CSS and Fortran, to C# and Javascript, I've built a good fundamental level programming ability that I hope to refine at my new job as an Apprentice Software Engineer.</p>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I've had a passion for photography ever since I ran round London at 5am when I was 15 and marvelled at the beauty of the city before it was bothered by its usual hussle and bussle. I like to take photos of the mundane; I like to find buildings, scenes and people that most wouldn't initially pick out as photogenic, and shine a light on them that changes how the world sees them.</p>
